Linux_workpackages_task
===================

Task at hand,  I'd like to start by setting up my own CentOS 6.5 instance on a virtual machine.
Since I never used that ''variation'' of Linux before. I'll be using 86x-64x version of CentOs 6.5 since I got my hands on that version first.

Installationa_and_setting_up
=====================

- First dialogue offers multiple options, I've selected '' Install or upgrade an existing system''
- After testing and verification of the CentOS image the installation proceeds, with the initial setup (selecting installation language, selecting keyboard for the system etc. )
- I've given it the hostname ''centhost''
- I've set my root password to '' P4$$word''
- next dialogue select '' Use All Space'' option
- next pick desktop install 
- after the installation is finished I'm prompted to reboot 
- during the first boot I've set up the time and a regular user for myself ''Ivan'' in this case
- now that I've entered desktop first i'll disable root and ad my user to sudoers
```

su root
~~enter password~~
yum install nano -y
usermod -g wheel Ivan
yum install sudo -y

```
-nano is a command line text editor which I'll need to edit the following files
-also I added my user to the wheel group as administrator
-and installed sudo
- now for some editing
```

nano /etc/sudoers
~~now find end set this lines to...~~
## Same thing without a password
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)     NOPASSWD: ALL
~~save changes~~
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
~~find and edit~~
PermitRootLogin no
~~save changes~~
/etc/init.d/sshd restart

```
-now I added my user to sudoers and disabled Root Logins
-now Iâ€™ll install the IT automation tool Ansible
- but first I have to install the EPEL repository 


```

wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-6*.rpm

```
- the EPEL repository provides useful software packages that are not included in the official CentOS repositories.
```
yum install ansible

```
- we'll return back to ansible later on
- now i will setup SHH client fail2ban
```

yum install fail2ban -y

```
-now I'll configure the basic setup
```

nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf
~~edit this lines to~~
# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not
# ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be
# defined using space separator.
Ignoreip = 127.0.0.1 10.0.2.15/24

# "bantime" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.
Bantime = 3600

# A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"
# seconds.
Findtime = 600

# "maxretry" is the number of failures before a host get banned.
maxretry = 3
~~save changes~~

```
