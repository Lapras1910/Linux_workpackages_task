Linux_workpackages_task
===================

Task at hand,  I'd like to start by setting up my own CentOS 6.5 instance on a virtual machine.
Since I never used that ''variation'' of Linux before. I'll be using 86x-64x version of CentOs 6.5 since I got my hands on that version first.

Installationa_and_setting_up
=====================

- First dialogue offers multiple options, I've selected '' Install or upgrade an existing system''
- After testing and verification of the CentOS image the installation proceeds, with the initial setup ( selecting installation language, selecting keyboard for the system etc. )
- I've given it the hostname ''centhost''
